							<p>
								All of participants were actively using internet, most of them bought more than 10 online product last year.
								However, none of them were candles so the websites were irrelevant to them. Most of participants refered to buy candle in shops so they could see its color and had its aroma before purchase.
								They all found the websites were easy to learn and use and they prefered Yankee Candle design more due to it consistent design.
								Both of the websites had a fair utility function, allowed participants to do simple searchs for products,add to cart, checkout .
								The only difference was products that they offered. Goose Greek candle offered more reference candle product than Yankee Candle which participants liked.
								The impression of the website usability is neutral because all user are internet active and they likely have seen more impressive usability from other websites  and used them before.
								The intend to use the websites were low since the two design were generic and the products were irrelevant to them comparing to other big online sale website.
								The participant were likely not the target customer of the two websites, therefore, the result could be more valuable if we had more participants.
